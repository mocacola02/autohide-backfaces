# Auto-Hide Backfaces
Automatic backface hider for Blender 5, intended for interior modeling using objects with flipped normals.
This is my first Blender extension, so some jank and bugs are to be expected.

## Install
To install the addon, download the source code from this repo as a ZIP file, in Blender go to Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons -> Top right dropdown -> Install from disk -> Select zip file
